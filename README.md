# Chickagos's Bike Sharing Data Analysis using Tableau

## Introduction
Divvy is Chicago's bike sharing system. With the city of Chicago, Divvy publishes historical trip data and makes it available for 
public use. Trip data spans back as early as 2013. That's a lot of data, so we'll be focusing on trips from the first half of 2019.

## About Dataset
Our data is split into two tables. First, the station table which describes all the different stations throughout Chicago, including 
a station's unique id, the station's name (usually described by the street intersection), the station's location via coordinates, and 
the number of docks available at each station.

Second, we have the trips table. Each row in the table represents a trip from the first half of 2019. Each trip has a unique trip id 
and the id of the bike used. The travel time for each trip is captured in seconds. We also have the exact time that the bikes are checked 
out and back in Central Standard Time, along with the name and id of the starting and ending stations. Divvy riders are either 
subscribers and non-subscribers, who are referred to simply as customers in the data. More information is known about subscribers 
because of the ongoing relationship, that is birthyear and gender.
</br>
From a data structure perspective, we have both categorical and numeric values. Having a mixture is important to create a variety of 
visuals. Remember that Tableau organizes data into two main groups: Dimensions and Measures, where Dimensions represent categorical or 
qualitative data and is color coded blue. Measures represent numerical data that can be aggregated and is color coded green. We can move 
fields between these two types, but we need to do it strategically. As we load any new data and begin analysis, an excellent first step 
is to make sure fields are placed in the right section. All numeric values, by default, arrive in the Measures section. If a numeric 
field is one that shouldn't be aggregated, then we will move them to the Dimensions section. IDs are great example of this, because 
it's meaningless to add or average up IDs.

## Data Preparations
1. Moved  4 (Birthyear, BikeId, Latitude, and Longitude) non-aggregating numeric values to the Dimensions section.
2. Created a calculated field called Tripduration (hrs) to show the values of Tripduration to hours.
3. Update the default properties of Tripduration (hrs) so it displays two decimal points and the suffix " hrs".

**How many stations have an average Tripduration (hrs) of more than 25 hours?**
By filtering average trip duration we have found **3 stations** and the values are pretty high.

Because we identified these outliers, we can better question and interpret our data. The reason these values are so high is because 
some bikes at these stations were taken overnight or stolen and the clock measurement took a long time to timeout.
</br>
Now, we will add refinements to the way that the data is being presented for clarity, consistency and context. Adjusting the horizontal 
layout of the canvas is a great way to allow the data to fill the available space. Adding a Highlighter allows for illumination of 
specific rows in the context of the remaining rows.
</br>
Using the Highlighter we added, **how many trips started at Adler Planetarium?**

The answer is 6120. </br>
Note this could be done with a Filter, but that would hide the other rows whereas Highlighters leave the remaining row members in 
place. This makes Highlighter great for quick searches and scans.</br>
4. Weekday or weekend
When analyzing consumer activity, it's common to compare weekends and weekdays. However, our data doesn't provide a field to directly 
classify the data this way. We can easily use the <code>Start Time</code>, which is a time stamp generated by the docks, and the 
Tableau <code>DATEPART()</code> function to identify if the day contained in the <code>Start Time</code> is a Sunday or Saturday. 
When <code>DATEPART()</code> is asked to consider the 'day' part of the time stamp, it will return a numeric value. Using IF/THEN/ELSE 
logic structure, we'll be looking for <code>1</code> for Sunday or <code>7</code> for Saturday.

Above picture shows that **Streeter Dr & Grand Ave** has the largest number of weekend trips after allowing filtering.

## Visualizations for exploratory analysis of trends
In this exercise, we'll do some basic trend analysis to visualize the overall pattern throughout the day. There are a lot of benefits 
to this type of analysis. Consider how this could drive decision making for managing staff, evaluating capacity for product 
availability, and even revealing low usage trends to schedule opportunities for promos (e.g., 50% off).
</br>
First of all, we will try to find out the trends by hour of day and customer type. Based on the below picture 

![alt text](https://github.com/asifsamy/chickago-bike-sharing-01/blob/master/images/6_Trends.JPG "Logo Title Text 1")

**Which hour has the lowest total number of rides between 7am and 7pm?**
The answer is 10 AM. Therefore, if we want to run a promo during light hours, than 10am could be a good option. However, if we look 
at the Customer user type only, we can see that it doesn't reach the minimum number of rides at 10am, but 7am, considering 7am-7pm 
only. It looks like it's worth doing a separate trend analysis between user types!</br>

Let’s explore another bin size for Start Time and add in Usertype as a way to slice and dice in order to find a weekly pattern by user.

From the picture, **What percent of riders are customers on Thursdays? (round to two decimal points)** The answer is 12.13%. If we 
did compute across, then we would get the distribution of customer rides across the weekdays. One isn't necessarily better than 
the other, it just depends what we're looking for! It's often worth exploring both.</br>
Now, **we want to analyse weekday trends by gender and time of day.**
For this we want to extend the data we currently have by defining time blocks. This should be made up of four six-hour periods: 
<strong>Night</strong> (12am-6am). <strong>Morning</strong> (6am-12pm), <strong>Afternoon</strong> (12pm-6pm), and 
<strong>Evening</strong> (6pm-12am). This will provide us another way to slice and dice our data.

**What percent of Tuesday rides are by female users in the morning? (round to two decimal points)The answer is 6.88%.**</br>
Here we see most riders are men and that the afternoon and morning are the busiest time slots. Note that you can hover over the 
blocks that lack a label to get their values. Remember, we don't have gender demographics for every user, hence why some blocks 
have an empty value for gender. </br>
Tableau allows us to quickly create creative visualizations. Quicker than it would take to program. Here you will create a Bubble 
Chart that shows the distribution of rider activity between known genders, across the trend of the days of the week.

**In the above picture each dot/bubble represents the number of rides taken by either male or female riders on a specific date and 
hour.**
However, when we look at all the bubbles together we can analyze the general weekday trends by the area of the colors and the gender 
trends by the size of the two bubbles.

#### Scheduling a promotional discount
The Divvy Marketing team wants to run a promotional campaign to increase customer purchases, which internally they have called the 
Two by Two Discount. The Two by Two Discount restricts the promotion to the two overall lowest riding days for customers and then 
the two lowest windows of time (**excluding the night window, 12am-6am**). Remember there are two types of users: customers and 
subscribers.

![alt text](https://github.com/asifsamy/chickago-bike-sharing-01/blob/master/images/10_trend-user-dashboard.JPG "Logo Title Text 1")

By visualizing the dashboard created based on the above analyses (Shown in this picture), we can see in the “Trend by Weekday and 
User Type” tree map that **Wednesday** and **Thursday** the customers have lowest usage. And from the “Trends by Hour of Day and 
Customer Type” **morning** and **evening** have the lowest usage (excluding night time). Therefore, these two lowest windows 
would be best fit for 
the promotion.
